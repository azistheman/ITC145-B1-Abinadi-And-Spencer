		<h1>The History of TVs: applications of the TV</h1>
		<p>By Spencer & Abinadi
		There are many applications you can use for a TV, starting with using it as a means to watch content
			Cable TV is a service you can buy where you can pay a distributor for the rights to watch a wide array of television channels, with different packages and price points being the main way to have the full catalogue of content
			Physical Media: you can hook up a device to play different forms of content over the years, originally it started with VHS' and then it slowly evolved into DVD's and then Blu-ray's as time passed, with physical media in your hands it allowed you to watch WHATEVER show WHENEVER, instead of relying on whatever was on at the time with Cable. now the changes in the media wasn't just for show, DVD's could pack a whole lot of content, a VHS of a tv show would usually be in "Volumes" because of the low space, only usually offering around 3 episodes of a show at a time, but with DVD's, they were cheaper to make, faster to produce, and stored WAY more content usaully allowing only 2 or so discs needed to run FULL seasons of a show, another way to get physical media of a show was through video rental stores, think like your blockbuster, it allowed consumers to pay for movies at a cheaper price to have for a night or 2, and then return back the next morning under the assumption you finished it, now unfortunately nearly every rental place is gone making it so you either have to pay a PREMIUM for a new movie, or pay cheap for a secondhand copy you can't see until after you buy it.
			Streaming Services: while in the past getting content to your TV has been through Cable or home media, nowadays you just need to pay $13 or so and get a CATALOGUE of content, hundreds of movies and tv shows at the tips of your fingers, no more spending $20 for 1 movie, or paying $100 for content that you can't guarentee will be on at that time, now you can watch it at your pace and in order, now streaming content to your tv is very appealing, but there is a downside, which is for most streaming services, you NEED to be online, and due to that the quality (no matter how good the tv) can often be worse than if you bought it physically, and you can't watch it if you decide that internet bill is gettng to high, which was not always the case with Cable which could avoid that trouble, but why discuss streaming services? well it's because of it's impact on Physical Media, due to the public's easy accessibility to Streaming it has unfortunately impacted sales on DVD's and Blu-RAY's, and it's machine to play them, which is unfortunate because it makes TV's just look plain bad
			Gaming: Gaming on a TV is nothing new, while their were arcade machines, we could hardly call that a TV screen, and arcades aren't important to this, so skipping the whole option to go arcade the first mainstream option for at home gaming would be the Nintendo Entertainment System more commonly known as the "NES", now the first years of gaming were in Standard-Definition, and due to TV'S at the time using Composition Cables, so did the gaming devices, but tv's weren't ready for that, tv's now hardly come capable with more than 1 comp device allowed, which caused gaming and watching TV being at a HUGE divide, it took a lot of effort to swap between the 2, but as the times passed and TV's changed so did gaming, now while HD tv's were technically avaiable in 1998, it was INCREDIBLY expensive, and it took a couple extra years before it became popular, but by 2009 it was in everyone's home, and watching TV and playing games were much easier to do with multiple HDMI's being available on many tv's
			Everyday Life: Tv's in everyday lifes has DRASTICALLY changed, back in the day most houses had only 1 TV, and it was in the family room, so if you wanted to watch it then EVERYONE would have to watch it, kids used to gather around for saturday morning cartoons, and parents would watch the news together, and during gamewshows the whole family would come together, to root for a big winner, as Tv's changed it was relatively the same, up until around 2007, when genuinely quality TV's were made widely available for the public, and as years went by it became even cheaper, now everyone has a TV in every room imaginable, kids bedrooms, kitchens, the bathroom, it's everywhere, and while it was great for the TV market, it caused a drastic change to the daily life of those with a TV, no more did kids rush downstairs to eat cereal and watch cartoons, now they can lay in bed and watch it in privacy without getting up, the news also became more accessible causing less and less news watchers, and now families are more split, being distracted by their own TV's, no more game night watches, no more would families do their makeshift Mystery Science Theatre, it became a split activity, and it became easier to disconnect from society with a TV everywhere you look
