		<h1>The History of TVs: Costs of TVs</h1>
		<p>By Spencer & Abinadi
		The cost of a television initially was incredibly high, with it being a CRT it was a big blocky thing, and it costed around $395, which nowadays would be around $8,800 for a TV, and a major difference would be the design, no only with it being a HUGE blocky thing, but it also had knobs on the front, and a MASSIVE speaker, and there was yet to be color on the screen
		Something that is less talked about is the price of TV remotes, with the first true remote being a "Lazy Bones" remote being priced around $30 ($388 nowadays) and it only had 2 knobs, a "tuning" knob and a "volume" knob, allowing people to mess with their tv without getting infront of it, or getting up, it made life even easier for families to enjoy their TV
		and now we get to COLOR, with a TV advertising to be 15 whole inches of screen, which is massive and with the 25MILLION  dollars spent on the research, it was a good TV to have in your house, but unfortunately due to it being incredibly revelutionary it was also incredibly expensive, so the price was around $1,200, if that was in todays prices it would be $15,000 thankfully for the consumers there was a MAJOR price cut down to $500, and while it was a major loss for the company, it was an incredible win for TV'S
		now we move onto the great TV race of 1959, being between Philco and Sony, with the race between them over portable TV's, it weighed 15 and a half pounds and allowed the user to bring their TV wherever thanks to a battery that you could use, now the battery wasn't the best, only offering around a 4 hour charge, and cost abour $5.25 for a rechargable battery, but evetually SONY did evntually come back and get a portable TV out into the market with a 13 pound TV, and it costed around the same price as the PHILCO being $250 ($2,700 nowadays), BUT there was a major difference, SONY had you buy a $30 battery, which added an extra 4 pounds, but due to the performance of the SONY it ended up being the better TV and it's what ended up being what consumers chose, also fun note this is the last TV we're covering which had a big ol' speaker on the front of it
		now most of these TV's stuck with the CRT model, but due to that TV'S could weigh up to a staggering 200 pounds in the 1990's, thankfully we have the wonderful FUJITSU compny to come by and not only create a lighter weight TV, but also a FLAT SCREEN tv in 1997, it was 42 inches and it had color and you can thank it to being a plasma TV, it was only a 3-inch thickness, and weighed only around 40 pounds, but not all things can be good, as this TV costed an ENORMOUS $17,500 ($37,000 nowadays) and that's being generous, unfortunately it wasn't a commercial success
		but now we finally get into the 2000's, coming out in 2004 we had a MASSIVE output of LED TV'S, now they've always sorta been around, but there was a brand new discovery which made it a more viable option, with Blue LED'S being introduced it meshed with the already existing red and green ones and allowed for the widest spectrum of colors ever available for LED'S, now per usual it did have a rather steep price point, with it being around $10,000 ($16,500 nowadays) at first, but with it being an amazing 46-inches, it was actually seen as a rather reasonable price
		and the new innovation which caused a massive upgrade in TV history, was a smart TV, now in 2008 it was exclusively released in Korea, and it wasn't labeled as a smart TV, rather as a "contents" TV and could access the internet through an ethernet cable, and could do what a lot of modern TV's could do now accessing things like Youtube and the News, and things of that nature, but thanks to Sony the west only had to wait around 2 years until they got their hands on a smart TV, retailing for $1,000 ($1,400 nowadays) and it was revelutionary...for the west, it was pretty much just the Koren "content TV" but still, for us to get a TV that could access Streaming Services was absolutely revelutionary
		then yet again only 2 more years till the next big innovation, the first 4K TV, it was an AMAZING 84-inch TV, and it was the absolute BEST quality you could get, and was rumored to be the reason Smart TV's weren't selling the best as possible, unfortunately, again per usual it had the MASSIVE price of $20,000 ($27,000 nowadays) and not long after later that month SONY entered the 4K ring, with an even more expensive price tag at around $25,000, BUT it did come with free speakers, and a free server with preloaded 4K movies, now due to the astronomical price tag on these it was not very well recieved by the public especially after how cheap the Smart TV's were
		now 3D technology has existed for a long while, and while it took a while for it to enter the homes of consumers it was worth it right...well no the quality ended up being poor, and the final ones on the shelf were around 2013 unfortunately it was seem as a fad, and not nearly enough things existed to allow the TV's to be viable by average consumers, and by 2012 the price was only $700 for a 55-inch TV, unfortunately it wasn't enough to retain the consumers attention and they've been phased out completely as of 2025, and a lot earlier then that being arodun 2017
