		<h1>The History of TVs: The Future</h1>
		<p>By Spencer & Abinadi
		There have been many TVs, looking to make small, or big improvements, and some things we can guess would be, 1: accessibility, 2: improvements, 3: extra features, 1: accessibility: throughout history TVs have been in 1 place, there was a portable TV before, and our phones have sorta become that, but what i'm proposing is that Tvs will become more accessible in many spaces of the average american family that haven't really been touched, such as in bed, I propose that TV beds will be made where someone will get in bed and then a TV would be raised from the foot side of the bed to allow watching even before bed, another place could be the bathroom, many tvshows and movies have suggested the idea that the mirror in a bathroom could be much more, giving news, weather reports, showing missed messages while in sleep, and of course watching shows while brushing teeth, or combing hair, and things of that nature, 2: Improvements: some improvments that they could make would be a remote that could change to whatever things you last visited, instead of set jumps I could imagine they allow a history kind of function so you can scroll back on your entire tv history and have buttons to jump, all Tvs will have voice activity in the same way of an Alexa, that would be another improvement that I could see them trying out to allow people to eat without wiping hands before grabbing the remote, and so even if you lose your remote you can still turn on the TV, 3: I could imagine if future TVs would have more and more quality of life changes, such as allowing you to view shows in a 4:3 and 16:9 ratio depending on what you like, and allowing more and more ports to be plugged in, and filters if you want to see a show in a specific way, and touching up older shows automatically to look as crisp as possible, things of that nature for viewers could be seen very soon especially if they don't continue making improvements to resolution of a TV
