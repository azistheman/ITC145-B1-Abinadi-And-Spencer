		<h1>The History of TVs: A history</h1>
		<p>By Spencer & Abinadi
		TVs have existed for over a century starting as far back as 1884, though admittedly it took 10 years before it properly made it's way into homes, and at that point it was seen as a norvelty, and barely anyone had it, thankully as the decades passed it did eventually start to pick up and it became a more common household item, now the frst CRT was a very mechanical heavy TV and used electromechanical projectors, and John Logie Baird was the first person to make it commercially available in 1925, though many people still found that due to it's poor quality it wasn't really worth it, but if we move 2 years forward we did get an electronic TV made by Philo Taylor Farnsworth, and the TV was mdae over the course of 7 years, the major difference between the two is how the visuals are made with the electronic TV using Electronic Signals by using radio waves, microwaves, or infared rays, now while the first color TV was thought of in 1904 it was unfortunately nfortunately never realized, and neither was the patent for a color electronic TV, and while it too nearly 20 years since the electronic TV made it's way into the market the color TV was finally relased in 1953 by a team of engineers at RCA laboratories, now as the years have progressed the TV got many revisions and tweaks, and TV remotes became common, and due to the publics want of sleaker looking TVs they had to switch from using a CRT TV into a Plasma TV, which allowed it to be flatter, removing knobs in the front, and moving the speaker away to allow the full front to be the screen, and that was in 1997, now moving into the 21st century we get more innovations, we get OLED tv's coming in around 2004 and has become a very popular choice for gaming, the PSVITA the PSVR 1 and 2 and the switch OLED all had OLED displays, and it's thanks to the innovations made by early TV manufacturers, and then 3d technology was introduced into the homes of those willing buy into it, though just like early televisions it was seen as a novelty and not really something to invest in, and while TVs were force to be in SD until 1998, it took 11 years before it was mandated that HD was the common viewing experince, causing many people to have to make the switch and that really had HD TVs boom into popularity, and over the years it's gotten better and better, and with the faster moving progression of technology we eventually got household commercial TVs getting to over 100 inches which is insane because we started at a 15 inch or so display at most, TVs have been able to keep up with the changing times just as much as everything else, and of course we're in an age now where we've really hit a cieling for the moment of what manufacturers will make, and consumers will buy, with people going out of their way just to make very minimal improvements to their displays, to the point where you're saying a mouthful, truly as TVs have progressed so has society, and as more TVs are made, more history is made, there's turning TVs, there's out of the ground TVs, Tvs you can roll around from a stand, truly even when we hit a ceiling of improvements, we just become inventive on what we can do with TVs
